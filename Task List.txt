ALL DONE Except some



Make More efficient:
-Make 2D array for aliens not ArrayList MAYBE but it might be effort
-Only iterate and test bullet collision if its above the lowest alien, same with obstacles
-dont do left() and right() all the time, use integer for leftmost and rightmost, increment when aliens move, only use left() and right() when alien dies
-test if bullet is hitting player only if it is within y values of player
